# CounterApp
 Azarias' Counter App built with React State Management
Instructions:
- To run the app, type in the terminal "npm start"
- Then head over to localhost:3000.

- Play around with the buttons to see how "increments" work in React!
- Also open up the console, if you would like to see the current "count".
